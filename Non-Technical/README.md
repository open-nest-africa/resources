# Non-Technical Resources

Welcome to the **Non-Technical** section of the OpenNest-Africa Resources Hub!

This space is dedicated to **non-code contributors** who are essential to building, maintaining, and growing open-source projects, from content creation and community management to design and localization.

We believe **everyone belongs in open source**, and this section is here to support you on that journey.
