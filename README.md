# 🌍 OpenNest-Africa — Resources Repository

Welcome to the **OpenNest-Africa Resources Repository** — a central hub for all the educational content we’re building to help **anyone, anywhere** get started with and contribute to **open source**.

---

## ✨ What is This Repository?

This repository houses articles, guides, videos, templates, and other resources created during community-led events and contributions — including our participation in the [OnlyDust Hackathon](https://onlydust.com).

It is organized around **three key audiences**:
- 👩‍💻 **Technical** contributors
- 📣 **Non-technical** contributors
- 🧭 **Explorers** (curious minds just getting started)

Our mission is to **make open source accessible** to everyone — regardless of background, location, or skill level.

---

## 🧑🏽‍🏫 Who Are We Creating These Resources For?

We’re building for:
- Students looking to gain real-world experience
- Designers, writers, and project managers who want to contribute beyond code
- Curious learners who don’t yet know where to begin
- Anyone who has felt like open source wasn’t made for them

Open source needs **everyone** — not just developers.

---

## 🔍 Understanding the Audiences

### 🧠 Technical
Developers, DevOps, testers — those writing or reviewing code, solving bugs, or working on infrastructure.

### ✍🏽 Non-Technical
Writers, designers, community managers, documentation contributors, translators, researchers, and others who contribute without writing code.

### 🧭 Explorers
Those new to open source who are still figuring out how they can fit in — no prior experience needed.
