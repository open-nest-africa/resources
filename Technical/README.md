#  Technical Resources

Welcome to the Technical section of the OpenNest-Africa Resources Hub!

This space is where we gather technical learning materials â€” including articles, videos, and comprehensive guides â€” to support open-source contributors on their journey.

## Structure

The resources here are organized into the following folders:

###  ðŸ“„ [Articles](./articles/)
Step-by-step write-ups, tutorials, and how-to guides.

### ðŸŽ¥ [Videos](./videos/)
Screencasts, walkthroughs, and recorded lessons.

###  ðŸ“˜ [Guides](./guides/)
In-depth resources like handbooks, contributor manuals, or structured learning paths.

## How to Contribute

Pick the format your resource fits into and add it to the relevant folder:
- Markdown files (`.md`) for writeups
- Links or embed codes for videos
- PDFs or structured docs for guides

Letâ€™s keep things organized so others can find and use your awesome contribution!
